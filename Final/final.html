        <h1>Welcome to the Twilight Galaxy</h1>
        <p>We want to explore the formation of constellations and the attraction between stars with glowing particles! You can see 80 particles with random directions and speeds, and the approaching particles will be automatically combined into dreamy patterns through connecting lines. Use your imagination to see what the abstract geometric shapes they form look like!</p>
        <p>Guided by an ethereal background music, you can create a fixed light point by clicking the mouse to attract surrounding particles and create your own attraction point! Each interaction presents a unique visual story, showcasing the interaction between your influence and random natural processes, and experiencing the interaction between the starry sky and the universe.</p>
        <p>On this page, click on the left mouse button to create a planet that attracts particles that are floating around. You can press d to enter delete mode and press the left mouse button again on the planet you have just created to delete it.</p>
        <p>The idea was originally created by: Zenghui Chu(zxhu3022), Haiyue Xu(haxu9606), Zhiyuan Huang(zhua3251)</p>
